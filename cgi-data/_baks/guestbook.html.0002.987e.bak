<li><b>I just went to the Monday morning BookMARK session with the 1st graders at Holmes Elementary--what fun! We read books, talked about Thanksgiving, and played math and reading games! The kids picked out such great books and are learning how to read and write so quickly! One little girl told me that if I lost the math game I would have to give her my lunch money, which she said was $50---but then she said I could buy her shrimp for lunch instead! :) She also told me that since I was under 62 I was a teenager.   </b><br>
