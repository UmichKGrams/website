<li><b>My daughter Kayleigh came home the other day very excited about her new UM Pen Pal, Christine (I think?). Kayleigh went on and on about how nice her new pen pal was and wanted to know where Farmington Hills (her home town) was. Being a member of the Briarwood/Pittsfield Kiwanis, Rishi had told me about the idea of having a pen pal program between UM students and elementary school kids last spring. I thought it was a great idea, but I never envisioned anything like this. You are all to be comended for taking on such a noble cause. You are all fine examples of what is good in this world. (GUSH, GUSH) Thanks for making my daughter's (and everybody's elses children) school day a little bit brighter.



<BR>



<BR>



Just a side note: Thanks to UM Circle K, our school last year raised about $450 from the "Boxtops for Education" program for the Mitchell PTO. Of the $450, about $320 was raised by Circle K. You can see what a difference Circle K is making.

Thanks Again for Everything!
