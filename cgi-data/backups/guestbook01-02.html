<li><b>Thank you to everyone who participated in K-Day on Friday! It was so much fun -- the pen pals from Ford couldn't stop singing the Victors, asking about their college pen pals, and wondering how they could become U of M students!



<BR>







<BR>



One pen pal, Matt B., kept saying "Go Blue" every time we walked by other U of M students. He told me that he's going to be a Superfan when he comes to U of M!
