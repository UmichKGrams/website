<li><b>I attended the 2001 kids fair this past February and I thought it was amazing. I guess I did not realize how much time and effort is put into K-grams until I had the opportunity to witness it first hand. I think K-grams truly reaches out to hundreds of little kids and puts smiles on all of their faces. I love the K-grams website as well. It is very accessible and the webcam is always fun to look at. My collection of K-grams tee-shirts only consists of one so far, but I do plan on expanding my K-gram wardrobe through the up-coming events, so do not worry. I can only hope that eventually K-grams will become known throughout schools all over the country. Those who are currently in K-grams and who have made K-grams what it is today, should be very proud of yourselves because you have contributed to something that cannot be expressed through words. Thank you very much K-grams!!!</b><br>
