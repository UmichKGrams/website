  <li><b>The top five reasons why YOU should do BookMARK: <BR>



    <BR>



    5) It's flexible to your schedule - you can go once, twice, or even fifty 



    times a month <BR>



    4) It provides a great way to meet other college students while mentoring 



    to Elementary students. <BR>



    3) The Elementary students look up to you and think you are AMAZING! <BR>



    2)You can practice saying "Toy Boat" ten times fast - your buddies will ask 



    you to do it! Try it - it's really hard! <BR>



    1) You want to have fun and make a difference in a little kids day! <BR>
