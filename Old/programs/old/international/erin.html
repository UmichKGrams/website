<b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080"><p>Why did you choose to spend a year abroad, and what made you choose Germany?</p></font></b>
<p>I chose to spend a year abroad because I really wanted to experience living and studying in another country.  I chose Germany because 
I will have the opportunity to improve my German speaking skills.   I want to be surrounded by the German language and culture all the 
time!</p>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080"><p>Have you ever been outside of the United States?  If so, where else have you 
been?</p></font></b>
<p>I've been to London, England once and Germany twice.  I went to Germany with my family for a two-week vacation.  The second time I 
went with my high school as an exchange student and had the chance to live with a German family for one month.  This trip to Germany, 
however, will be the longest time that I've been away from home!</p>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080"><p>What are a couple of things that you hope to accomplish in Germany?</p></font></b>
<p>I hope to make lots of memories and meet new people.  I also want to be able to speak German fast and really well by the end of the 
year.  I would like to visit many places in Europe besides Germany-- France, Italy, and more!</p>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080"><p>What are you most nervous about?</p></font></b>
<p>I think I'm nervous because all my classes I take will be in another language!  Hopefully I'll be able to understand the important 
stuff.</p>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080"><p>Name one thing that you will miss about Ann Arbor or the US.</p></font></b>
<p>I'll definitely miss friends and family, but I'll also miss driving a car and going to Saturday football games in the Michigan 
Stadium.</p>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080"><p>What was your favorite activity to do during recess?</p></font></b>
<p>I really liked to play on the tire swing.</p>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080"><p>Please list some hobbies and/or activities that you enjoy.</p></font></b>
<p>In my free time I like to write letters to my pen pals all over the world.  I enjoy spending time with my family, hanging out with 
my friends, and taking walks with my mom.</P>

<b><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#000080"><p>Anything you would like to say to your classroom?</p></font></b>
<p>I'm so excited that I can share my year with you!  I hope by the end you will know a lot about me and Germany!<p>
