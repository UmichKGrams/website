          <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If you must leave 
            in the middle of a shift, be sure that there are enough student group 
            volunteers at your booth to cover the shift. There should be AT LEAST 
            2 volunteers at the booth at all times.</font></p>

            of our group members would like to hang out with the kids during the

            </font></font></b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Your group 
            members can hang out with the elementary kids all day, as long as 
            your booth has enough help. Just tell your group members to sign up
