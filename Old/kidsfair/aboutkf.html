        is a mentoring and learning program that pairs college and elementary 
        school students through a suite of programs. In its sixth year as a student-led 
        organization, K-grams brings together people from all facets of the University 
        of Michigan campus and the local community.</span></p>
      <p align="justify">The highlight of the year-long program is the K-grams 
        Kids-Fair, where elementary school pen pals, college students, parents, 
        teachers, and faculty fill Crisler Arena to celebrate an entire year of 
        Kids Programs at the University of Michigan. This expansive participation 
        makes Kids-Fair the single largest student-run volunteer event on campus. 
        These elementary school pen pals spend an entire day with college buddies, 
        participate in hundreds of activities sponsored by over 100 student organizations, 
        and experience different highlights of college in one day!<br>
