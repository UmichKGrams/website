    It must have taken you a lot of time and organizing to make it so special.
    One of my favorite parts of it was being with my K-gram, Priya. She had
    sacrificed her whole day to be with me! Wasn't that nice of her? Although
    some K-grams couldn't make it, all my classmates have received and treasured
    the wonderful letters from them. Thank You K-grams! We really appreciated
    this grand event you made for us!&quot;</font></td>
