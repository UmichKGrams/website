<ul>

 <li><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">	How am I matched up with my pen pal?</font></b><br>

  <br>

  Each hall is paired up with a specific elementary school. Within each school, there are 3-5 classes that participate in the pen pal program.  We assign college pen pals (that's you!) to a specific class randomly, while trying to keep those who live near each other in the rez halls paired up with the same elementary school class.  Next, we send a list of U of M pen pals to your class's teacher. The teacher will then pair you up with an elementary school student based on similar interests, and he/she will be your pen pal for the year!<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>How old is my pen pal?</b></font><br>

  <br>

  You can estimate your pen pal's age based on what grade he/she is in.  If you cannot remember the grade, look up your pen pal's teacher and school on the website

  (<a href="../hallschool.html">click here</a>) or simply ask your pen pal.<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>What if my friends want to be pen pals?</b></font><br>

  <br>
          If it is before September 10th, and they live in a residence hall, have 
          them pick up an application at the hall front desk and turn it in. After 
          Sept. 10th, they can email <a href="mailto:smile@umich.edu">smile@umich.edu</a> 
          and be placed on a waitlist. However, there are many other great ways 
          to get involved with K-grams. We are always looking for new and enthusiastic 
          people to join the program. Contact <a href="mailto:smile@umich.edu"> 
          smile@umich.edu</a> to become involved with our mentoring and reading 
          program - <a href="../bookmark.html">BookMARK</a>, participate in classroom

Letter Process</b></font></p>

<ul>

 <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>	When is my next letter due?&nbsp;</b></font><br>

  <br>

  Check out the <a href="schedule.html">letter schedule</a> on the web page, in your pen pal packet, or talk to your

  <a href="../hallschool.html"> Swing Kid</a>.  Remember that each month, all letters are due by 8pm  Monday night in your residence hall library.<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Where do I drop off my letter?<br>

  </font></b><br>

  Go to your residence hall library and look for a decorated collection box with the name of your pen pal's teacher on it.  Simply place your letter in the correct drop box, and let us do the rest!<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>What if my drop box is not in the library?<br>

  </b></font><br>

  Get in touch with your <a href="../hallschool.html"> Swing Kid</a> to inform them of the situation.  If  you notice that the box is missing outside of when your letter is due, make sure your

  <a href="../hallschool.html"> Swing Kid</a> places a new box in the library before the next letter due date.&nbsp;<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">What if I'm not around for the letter drop-off day?<br>

  </font></b><br>

  Contact your <a href="../hallschool.html"> Swing Kid</a> ahead of time and let him/her know that you cannot drop the letter off in the box. You must then work out some alternative drop-off in this situation.  Unless you have a serious conflict, you should make every effort to turn in your letter on time.&nbsp;<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">When will my pen pal write me back?<br>

  </font></b><br>

  You will receive a letter from your pen pal a couple of weeks after your letter due date, but the exact time is a surprise … so, check your mailboxes often!</li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#0B007E" size="5"><b><a name="letterformat"></a>Letter

Format</b></font></p>

<ul>

 <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>	What is the format for letters?</b></font><br>

  <br>

  Please refer to your &quot;<a href="writingletters.html">A Pen Pal's Guide to Letter

  Writing</a>&quot; sheet in your packet or on the website.<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Do I have to use a certain kind of paper or handwriting for the letters?<br>

  </font></b><br>

  Any 8 ½" x 11" paper will do, however do not use one side of a piece of paper that already has information/writing on its other side. Other guidelines to remember: do not use special-sized stationery and be sure to print your letters (do not use cursive).  Also, please consider writing in larger font than you would normally (keep in mind that little pen pals are still learning to read and write).&nbsp;<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">May I write on both sides of one sheet of paper?<br>

  </font></b><br>

  No. Please only write on one side of a blank 8 ½ x 11 sheet. After you tri-fold your letter, you must place both your address and your pen pal's address on the back of the fold.<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>Do I need to write my address on my first letter?<br>

  </b></font><br>

  Yes!  Tri-fold your letter in a business-like manner.  On the outside put your name, room number, and residence hall in the upper left hand corner.  In the center of the folded part, write your pen pal's name, teacher's name, and the elementary school.  Remember, please do not share your home address with your pen

  pal.<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Is it ok if I don't write a whole page to my pen pal?<br>

  </font></b><br>

  Please write approximately one page.  The kids compare letters, and we don't want any of them to feel like they received less.  However, if you are writing to a pen pal in the younger age bracket (grades 1 or 2), it may be wise to include some more pictures and not overwhelm them with too many words.<br>

 </li>

</ul>

<p><font face="Comic Sans MS" color="#0B007E" size="5"><b><a name="lettercontent"></a>Letter

Content</b></font></p>

<ul>

 <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>	What if I don't know what to write about?<br>

  </b></font><br>

  Talk to your friends or <a href="../hallschool.html"> Swing Kid</a> to brainstorm ideas.  You can tell a story about when you were younger, talk about a class you really like, mention your favorite sports and music, talk about something fun you did, or tell about yourself.  Ask your pen pal questions (appropriate of course) about pets, siblings, school, games, etc.<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>May I include drawings and pictures with my letters?<br>

  </b></font><br>

  Sure - be creative!  Draw as much as you'd like on the letter.  Please DO NOT SEND PHOTOS OF YOURSELF to your pen pal; this is unfair to all the other little kids.  You can draw a cool self-portrait, if you'd like.  If you really want to send a photo, talk to your

  <a href="../hallschool.html"> Swing Kid</a> about sending pictures from all the college pen pals to your pen pal's class.<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>May I write about specific holidays?<br>

  </b></font><br>

  You may not directly mention holidays because many kids may not observe them. If your pen pal mentions a holiday first, however, you may mention it in your response back to him/her.</li>

<ul>

 <li><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">Can I send my pen pal a present?<br>

  </font></b><br>

  You cannot send your individual pen pal a present, but you can work out something with your

  <a href="../hallschool.html"> Swing Kid</a> and the college pen pals who are writing to your class. Talk to your

  <a href="../hallschool.html"> Swing Kid</a> if you have ideas and get the other pen pals in your hall involved.<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">What if all of the college pen pals in my class want to chip in to get the class a present, but I don't want to?</font></b><br>

  <br>

  You don't have to spend money on anything that you don't want to.  If other college pen pals want to spend money on the class that your pen pal is in, that's great. Just be sure to let the other college pen pals and your

  <a href="../hallschool.html"> Swing Kid</a> know that you don't want to chip in for the gift.<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">May I exchange email addresses or phone numbers with my pen pal?  May I send my pen pal an email?</font></b><br>

  <br>

  No.  Many principals, teachers, and parents are not comfortable with that type of interaction.  For various safety reasons, you may not communicate with your pen pal through email or phone calls. Also, you may not meet your pen pal in person unless it is through an event or activity hosted by K-grams.&nbsp;<br>

  Please try your best to understand the letter, remembering that your pen pal is only in elementary school. If you cannot figure out what is written, please contact your

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><b><font size="4" color="#FF0000">What if I think my pen pal has a problem or needs help?<br>

  Inform your <a href="../hallschool.html"> Swing Kid</a> IMMEDIATELY and email <a href="mailto:smile@umich.edu">smile@umich.edu</a> ASAP. Do not keep any such information a secret with your pen pal. Always keep the safety and good health of your pen pal as the most important priority! Your pen pal may "cry out for help" to you and in this situation, do not act on your own.  You MUST inform

  <a href="mailto:smile@umich.edu">smile@umich.edu</a> and report what was written that made you believe your pen pal has a problem or needs help.  Please don't be reserved about this!</li>

  <a href="../spc/meetheads.html">Hall Heads</a> or <a href="../hallschool.html"> Swing Kids</a> will contact you to let you know when projects are taking place for your class.  You can also check the

 </li>

 <li><font color="#FF0000" size="4"><b>Can I attend projects for classes other than my own?<br>

  </b></font><br>

  Yes!  We encourage you to attend projects whenever you can, for any class at any school.  We understand that you may have classes or other commitments during the time when projects are scheduled for your specific class. Just look on the

  <a href="../main/calendar.html">Calendar of Events</a> or contact your <a href="../spc/meetheads.html"> Hall Heads</a> for a list of projects taking place in other classes and

  Contact your <a href="../spc/meetheads.html"> Hall Heads</a> or <a href="../hallschool.html"> Swing Kids</a> to inform them of the idea.  You can work with your

  <a href="../spc/meetheads.html"> Hall Heads</a> to set up an "edu-active" (educational and interactive) project with your class and become as involved in the planning as you would like. Don't be afraid to share your ideas,

  <a href="../spc/meetheads.html"> Hall Heads</a> always like hearing from you!<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>Do I have to attend projects?&nbsp;<br>

  </b></font><br>

  You are not required to attend projects, but we ask that you meet your pen pal at least once during the year.  We understand that project times may interfere with your classes, so

  we try to offer a wide range of times and days.  Also, you may go with your <a href="../spc/meetheads.html"> Hall Heads</a> to the schools to deliver and/or pick up letters, too.  The elementary kids really enjoy interacting with their college buddies during the school year. Remember that you are a special friend to your pen pal, who will learn a lot from your involvement.<br>

  <br>

 </li>

 <li><font size="4" color="#FF0000"><b>Who can attend projects?<br>

  </b></font><br>

  Anyone can attend projects! So, ask your buddies in your hall, your classmates, or your friends who live off-campus to come to projects. K-grams has so many unique ways for everyone to get involved.<br>
