     <p><em>As a Swing Kid, you will be in charge of collecting and packaging

     letters for a classroom. You'll be working with one other Swing Kid - your

     &quot;partner&quot; - as a pair, so you two will get out as much fun,

     energy, and interaction as you put into this role. Remember, if you have

     questions, your Swing partner is a good person to go to first.</em></p>

    <ul>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if a pen pal doesn't know what to

      write about?</font>

      <p>Help them brainstorm a couple ideas. They can tell a story about when

      they were younger, tell about a class they really like, something fun they

      did, something about themselves, something related to the classroom theme,

      or ask questions of their pen pal (appropriate of course) or tell about

      siblings, pets, hobbies, etc.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">How do I collect the letters?</font>

      <p>Simple enough-just wander down to your hall's library after 8 PM on the

      Monday night letters are due and collect the letters from the box with

      your teacher's name on it. Then, as a Swing Team, go through the class

      list and make sure there are no missing letters. If there are, contact the

      students who have not turned in a letter and ask them to do so as soon as

      possible. When all of the letters are collected, put them in the awesome

      package you made and get the whole thing to your hall's Letter Head by

      THURSDAY EVENING!</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">How do I make a package?</font>

      <p>Be creative! For some Swing Teams, elaborate packages were created,

      with each letter constituting one petal of a flower; for others, a package

      was a little wooden crate with &quot;Special Delivery&quot; and

      &quot;Handle with Care&quot; stenciled on the side. Just make sure the

      teacher's name is on the package. Contact your Letter Head if you are

      having trouble with ideas. Remember - the teachers will be keeping

      these!&nbsp; You can also look at our <a href="packages.html">package

      examples</a> to get ideas!</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What's the format for the first letter?</font>

      <p>For the first letter, pen pals should head the letter &quot;Dear

      Elementary school student&quot;. The letter should be one page long. Pen

      pals should tell a little about themselves, and ask lots of questions. The

      letters should close with your first name and last initial, room #, and

      hall. Also, be sure to write the teacher and school on the outside of the

      letter.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What's the format for the second and

      subsequent letters?</font>

      <p>One page of 8 ½ x 11 notebook paper. Writing should be double-spaced

      and printed (no cursive), unless the little kid took the initiative and

      wrote in cursive first. The letters should be signed with a first name and

      last initial, along with room and house number. The letters should then be

      tri-folded, with the little kid's name, teacher, and school written on the

      outside. The pen pal should write his name and room number in the upper

      left-hand corner. Unfortunately, due to school policies, no real

      addresses, email addresses, or pictures can be exchanged. If a big kid

      wants to send a present to his/her little kid, he has to send enough so

      that the entire class has a gift in order to avoid any hurt feelings.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">If my class has a theme, do pen pals

      have to write about that theme?</font>

      <p>The theme can be incorporated into letters, but it is not necessary.

      Themes can often help pen pals who are struggling and need something

      structured to write about. Teachers would appreciate it if a few letters

      did have something related to their themes, but don't strain yourselves if

      you can't!</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Can I write on the back of the page?</font>

      <p>Please DO NOT WRITE ON THE BACK except to address the letter or

      decorate it.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Can I include drawings and pictures

      with my letters?</font> You can draw on the page and decorate the letter

      after it's tri-folded. However, do not send any pictures, because it would

      be unfair to the rest of the little kids.

    </ul>

    <br>

    <font size="+2" color="#0B007E">Conflicts/Problems:</font>

    <ul>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if I am having trouble locating a

      pen pal who hasn't turned in a letter?</font>

      <p>Contact your Letter Head and keep trying to get in touch with your pen

      pal. Email, call, and/or stop by the room of this pen pal if you must. It

      is your responsibility to have that letter from them ASAP. In the event

      that your pen pal won't turn in a letter, you may have to write the letter

      for them this time.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if I don't get along with members

      of my Swing Team? Or what if a member is not doing their job?</font>

      <p>If a member is not doing their job, don't freak out! Try to work out

      the problem with the specific person. If the Swing Kid cannot perform

      his/her duties just as an isolated incident, distribute his/her duties

      amongst the other Swing Kids as necessary. If problems persist that you

      can't handle, talk to your Letter Head. If your Letter Head is the

      problem, you can contact smile@umich.edu. Since you are all volunteering

      to work towards a common goal, you should be able to work things out.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if I want to drop out?</font>

      <p>You have signed a contract committing yourself to this program for the

      year. If circumstances necessitate your leaving the program, you must

      contact your Letter Head immediately. Please remember, however, that you

      made a commitment to the program and these kids… they need your help!</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if a pen pal of mine drops out or

      wants to drop?</font>

      <p>After the initial letter, you must try your hardest to encourage pen

      pals not to drop. You can not replace a dropped pen pal with someone you

      have found to take his or her space. Repeat, you CANNOT fill a dropped pen

      pal space. Immediately inform &quot;smile&quot; of the situation, and

      you'll be informed of what to do from there. In some cases, we will take a

      pen pal from the waiting list to replace the delinquent pen pal, but we do

      not want that situation to arise!</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if I don't have access or money

      for materials for the letter packages?</font>

      <p>Most stores can get you an empty box if you just ask. If you need blank

      white paper, we can probably get that for you. Talk to your Swing partner

      and try to coordinate materials in advance. If you begin planning

      larger-scale gifts and projects, the hall councils may start appropriating

      funds as necessary.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if I lost the names and/or

      information of my Swing Team members or Pen Pals?</font>

      <p>Check out this information throughout this webpage or contact your

      Letter Head.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if I'm going to be away the week

      the letters are due?</font>

      <p>Make sure your Swing partner knows this. If they are ok with covering

      for you, that's fine; otherwise, you must arrange for someone to check to

      make sure that your pen pals have written their letters. Be sure to notify

      your Letter Head, so they aren't waiting around to pick up your package,

      completely clueless.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if my drop box isn't in the

      library?</font>

      <p>The letter drop box should never leave the library. If it's not there,

      contact your Swing partner to see if he/she has the box. If neither of you

      can find the box, contact your Letter Head.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if my Swing Team can't work out a

      time to meet to make the package?</font>

      <p>You and your partner should be able to find a good time to meet,

      considering the packages must be done BEFORE the Monday due date. That

      leaves you plenty of time. If this is not possible, one person may have to

      miss a meeting, but try to make sure you can both meet the next month.</p>

    </ul>

    <font size="+2" color="#0B007E">Other Questions:</font>

    <ul>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Who is on the programming board?</font>

      <p>Lots of fun people that love to smile. :)</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">Will we ever go Swing dancing?</font>

      <p>We'd love to! Would you? Let us know when and where and we'll send the

      word out!</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if I want to be more involved?</font>

      <p>We'd love your help! There are always things you can do, but you may

      need to be assertive. Email smile@umich.edu and tell us you'd like to be

      more involved. If you know in what way you want to be involved, please

      specify.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if I have a pen pal who wants to

      get more involved?</font>

      <p>Have him/her email smile@umich.edu with whatever ideas he/she has and

      we can go from there. All it takes is a little initiative!</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What should I do with my package after

      it's ready?</font>

      <p>You'll have to work with the Letter Head on how and when you'll be

      getting the package to him/her. Please make sure everything is together

      (both packages and letters!) before you make the exchange!</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What are my library hours?</font>

      <p>Visit our website at www.umich.edu/~smile and find the hours under

      Halls &amp; Schools.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">What if I have a university pen pal who

      wishes to write to a specific little kid? <i>For example, the pen pal

      wants to write to the same pen pal she had last year.</i></font>

      <p>This pen pal may be difficult to locate, considering this child may be

      located in a different classroom this year, which may or may not be

      involved in K-grams. It is up to the Letter Head to decide if this is a

      feasible option.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">I have a project idea. What do I do

      next?</font>

      <p>Contact your hall's Project Head. If the idea came from you, another

      Swing Kid, or a pen pal, that person is more than welcome to help the

      Project Head plan the project.</p>

     <li><font size="+1" color="#FF0000">How do I help my pen pals get to know

      each other better?</font>

      <p>You can organize letter-writing parties, Rock-n-Bowl nights, Diag

      lunches - anything you want! You have lots of ways to get ideas for this.

      One of the best is to talk to your pen pals and see what they would like

      to do. Another is to brainstorm with your Letter and Project Heads. Or,

      you can also stop by the K-grams office in the Union and chat with us

      about it.</p>
