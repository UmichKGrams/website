      <td colspan="2"><font face="Times New Roman">As a Swing Kid, you supervise the letter collection each month and encourage college pen pal involvement for one elementary school classroom. You will work together with your Hall Heads and the other Swing Kids in your residence hall to develop a sense of pride and community within your hall. Your role is an integral part of K-grams, as you are the direct link between the college pen pals and the rest of the program. You are their source of information about letters, projects, and other kids programs.</font>

        <p><font color="#000080" size="5" face="Times New Roman"><i>Main Responsibilities:<br>

          </i></font><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Collect Letters, Make Packages, 

          Have Fun:</b></font></p>

        <ul>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Collect letters from the letter drop box in the hall library on Monday night at 8pm. Check through the letters and contact, immediately, those pen pals who have not turned in their letters.</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Meet with your Hall Heads and the other Swing Kids in your hall on Monday night after the letters are due to discuss issues with the letters and upcoming events. ALL letters must be delivered to the Letter Head by Wednesday so the kids will receive them on Friday.&nbsp;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Thoroughly read through all letters before you send them on to your Hall Heads!</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Create a package for the letters. You should do this one week before letters are due, so you'll have extra time to collect letters and get organized
            before the letter delivery. This is your chance to be creative and original, so get wild with the packages!&nbsp;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Promote fairness between the college and elementary pen pals: Every little pen pal MUST receive the same things (i.e. letters, candy, gifts, etc.)</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Inform your Hall Heads about what is going on with letters and your pen pals.  Let him/her know of any problems, upcoming events, or any comments/ideas from the pen pals.&nbsp;</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Promptly answer any pen pal questions or direct them to someone who can help.  Remember - you're the pen pal's link to K-grams!</font></li>
        </ul>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Encourage Pride and Community in Your 

          Hall:</b></font></p>

        <ul>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Build relationships among college pen pals by assisting Hall Heads in organizing events such as letter-writing parties, a Rock-N-Bowl, or a pizza party in you hall!</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Frequently call or visit pen pals just to say "hi" and see how they are doing</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Work with Hall Heads to maintain the K-grams bulletin board/display in your hall, keeping it updated with the latest information</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Inform pen pals about projects in your elementary classroom, and other school events, and encourage them to attend</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Promote participation in projects, BookMARK, Kids-Fair, K-day, and other kids programs</font></li>
        </ul>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Get Your Creative Juices Flowing:</b></font></p>

        <ul>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Meet with your Hall Heads and other Swing Kids monthly to discuss upcoming K-grams events, plan projects, and coordinate activities to do with your hall</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Create a "pen pal poster" to display all the college pen pals' photos in the elementary classroom</font></li>
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Work with the other Swing Kids in your hall to generate a fun, age-appropriate, "edu-active" project involving both the elementary and college pen pals</font></li>
        </ul>

        <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman">If your pen pal has a problem 

          or question that you cannot answer, contact your <a href="../spc/meetheads.html">
