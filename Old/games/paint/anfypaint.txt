INTRODUCTION.

This applet is a complete paint program, with freehand and geometric
drawing tools. It is possible to save painted images to the web space
where you placed the applet, via the mailserver (smtp, port 25).

The images will be sent to a specified e-mail address, as attacched JPG
files. This will allow everyone to receive paintings from their visitors,
to build graphical bookmarks, or interactive virtual galleries.

The JPG saver is based on the work of JPEG group.

If a background image is specified, the applet becomes a colouring book.

PARAMETER DESCRIPTIONS

The following instructions describe the meaning of the available 
parameters for this applet:

[Specify the applet and its size]

<applet archive="anfypaint.jar" code="anfypaint.class" width="580" height="350">

The size of the applet is determined by width and height tags.
The minimum width is 580 ,while the minimum height is 150.

NOTE:

You can make larger paint areas but not smaller.

[Credit parameter]

<param name="credits" value="Applet by Fabio Ciucci (www.anfyteam.com)">

Attempting to change the credit parameter will disable the applet.

[Registration parameters]

<param name="regcode" value="NO">         ; Registration code (if you have it)

To activate the reg parameters, read the shareware registration notes.
In the "regcode" parameter, place the registration code you purchased 
from us. If the code is correct and the applet is run from the registered
 domain name, "link" parameters will be enabled and the applet will be
linked to an associated URL when it mouse-clicked.

[Image save options]

<param name="savebutton" value="YES">     ; Save button (YES / NO)

When the applet has a regcode, you can set "YES" at the "savebutton" parameter
so as to enable the send button.

<param name="jpgquality" value="75">      ; Jpeg saving quality (1..100)

Remember you can change compression level of the saved images, with the
"jpgquality" parameter. Higher values result in high quality as well as
bigger file sizes. The range goes from 1 to 100, and best results are around 75.

<param name="sendtomail" value="mypaint@mysite.com">  ; Mail where send image

The registered applet will send the output images using smtp port of the server
as mail attachments. You can specify the e-mail with the "sendtomail" parameter.
With some CGI programming, you can automatically upload the saved images to your
site.

NOTE:

Due to security limitations, the applet can connect only to the same server 
from which it is loaded. This means, if your applet is running on server.com 
(port 80; www server), it will connect to the server.com port 25 (smtp mail 
server port), and try to send the images as mail attachments. However, if the
 mail server is absent, or does not allow public access, your anfypaint can't
send the images.

[Background]

<param name="backcolor" value="e0e0e0">   ; Nackground colour (hex RRGGBB format)
<param name="backimage" value="NO">       ; Background image (it's name or "NO")

Use "backcolor" to change background colour. The format is same as the html
colour format, without the leading #.

If you want to display an image in the background, place its name in the
place of "NO" at backimage parameter (for example "colorbook.jpg").
This can transform the anfypaint in a coloring book for kids, for example.

NOTE:

If you select the background image smaller than the paint area, it cannont
fully cover the are, however this is acceptable. 

[Pen colour]

<param name="pencolor" value="000000">    ; Start pen color (hex RRGGBB format)
<param name="startmsg" value="Click here."> ; Starting screen message

You can decide the default pen colour with "pencolor", while the default message
printed on screen with "startmsg".
