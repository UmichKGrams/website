        <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Kasie is thrilled to be 
          a part of K-grams and helping with Kids-Fair. She can't think of anything 
          better than watching 850 elementary schoolers having fun. She enjoys 
          kids of all ages, all sports and almost anything outdoors (except camping!) 
          and loves to spend an afternoon watching television and sleeping which 
          she doesn't get to do very often. She goes by the motto Why not? rather 
          than Why? (like when she went skydiving last summer--10,000 feet Baby!) 
          and doesn't hesitate to say what she thinks.</font></p>
