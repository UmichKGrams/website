        Throughout the year you will work with this group of pen pals, ensuring 

        that all letters are turned in on the monthly due date, facilitating interaction 

        among the pen pals, and acting as the pen pals&#8217; main contact with 

        K-grams. </font></p>

        classroom projects. Developing a strong relationship with your pen pals, 

        you and your residence hall team will establish an enjoyable community 

        of learning in the residence halls.</font></p>
