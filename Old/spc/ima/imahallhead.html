          <p><em>As a Hall Head, your role is a pivotal one that is interactive 
            with the elementary schools, the college pen pals, and the SPC. In 
            most instances, this role requires self-initiative to enhance the 
            letter writing process and exchanges, as well as to create and execute 
            projects as much as you desire! You will work directly with a Hall 
            Head partner assigned to your residence hall to ensure that letters 
            are exchanged accurately and timely each month, that each classroom 
            does one &quot;edu-active&quot; (educational and interactive) project 
            per semester, and that pen pals stay involved with the program in 
            other ways</em></p>

        <ul>
          <li>Work closely with your Hall Head partner to actively communicate 
            with each teacher at your school regarding all aspects of the program. 
            <i>You are the link between the University and the elementary school!</i> 
          <li>Ensure timely letter collection and delivery through close contact 
            with your Swing Kids. 
          <li>Strengthen personal relations among Swing Teams and pen pals within 
            your residence hall. 
          <li>Keep Swing Kids, pen pals, and teachers informed of all upcoming 
            events and other pertinent information. 
          <li>Attend weekly meetings with the Pen Pal Directors and the other 
            Hall Heads; update them on the status of projects and other exchange 
            ideas.
          <li>Maintain regular communication with the BookMARK Coordinator(s) 
            who are working with a classroom in your school.
          <li>Serve as a liaison to your hall council, informing them of K-grams 
            activities and encouraging involvement. 
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Communicate project ideas to each teacher 
            to create a project beneficial to each individual classroom and all 
            pen pals. </font> 
          <li><font face="Times New Roman">Assist Swing Kids in encouraging pen 
            pals to generate project ideas; help spur active participation and 
            attendance with projects. </font>

        <font size="+2" color="#0B007E"><em>A little more concrete...</em></font> 
        <ul>
          <li>Every other Friday, between you and your Hall Head partner, someone 
            MUST get to your school! Letters will either have to be delivered 
            and/or picked up! The teachers will be expecting you! 
          <li>Each time you go to your school, each teacher should (MUST!!) hand 
            you a completed "Teacher Update" form. Turn in the form--even if it 
            is BLANK--at your weekly meeting to one of the Directors. THIS IS 
            ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY! 
          <li>The Teacher Update form includes a very important section where 
            teachers will write any changes in their class lists, such as a student 
            who moved away. It is imperative that you turn in a Teacher Update 
            form at your weekly meetings after each letter drop-off or pick-up 
            in order for the changes to be processed. 
          <li>Once the change is processed, the affected Swing Kid(s) will be 
            contacted by email; at the next weekly meeting, you will receive a 
            processed change sheet and updated class list for your own records. 
            Be prepared--Swing Kids will come to YOU with questions about this! 
          <li>Work with your Swing Kids to build pen pal relations. Maybe sponsor 
            a letter-writing party, organize a pizza party, go rock-n-bowling...it 
            is all up to you.
