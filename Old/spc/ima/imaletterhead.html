		<p><em>As a Letter Head, your role is a pivotal one that is interactive with the elementary schools, the college pen pals, 

		and the Programming Council.  In most instances, this role requires self-initiative to enhance the letter writing process 

		and exchanges as much as you desire!  You will also work with a Project Head assigned to your residence hall to ensure that 

		each classroom does one project during the course of the year and that pen pals stay involved with the program in other 

		ways.</em></p>

<font size="+2" color="#0B007E"><em>Main responsibilities:</em></font>

<ul>

	<li>Work closely with your hall's Project Head to actively communicate with each teacher at your school regarding all aspects 

	of the program.  <i>You are the link between the University and the elementary school!</i>

	      <li>Ensure timely letter collection and delivery through close contact 
            with your Swing Kids. 
          <li>Strengthen personal relations among Swing Teams and pen pals within your dorm.

	      <li>Keep Swing Kids, pen pals, and teachers informed of all upcoming 
            events and other pertinent information.
          <li>Encourage Swing Kids and pen pals to come up with interactive project ideas and convey these ideas to your Project Head.

	<li>Attend weekly meetings with the Directors and the other Heads.

	<li>Serve as a liaison to your hall council, informing them of K-grams activities, encouraging involvement, and soliciting 

	funding for the program.

</ul>



<font size="+2" color="#0B007E"><em>A little more concrete...</em></font>

        <ul>
          <li>Every other Friday, between you and your hall's Project Head, someone 
            MUST get to your school! Letters will either have to be delivered 
            and/or picked up! The teachers will be expecting you! 
          <li>Each time you go to your school, each teacher should (MUST!!) hand 
            you a completed "Teacher Update" form. Turn in the form--even if it 
            is BLANK--at your weekly meeting to one of the Directors. THIS IS 
            ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY! 
          <li>The Teacher Update form includes a very important section where 
            teachers will write any changes in their class lists, such as a student 
            who moved away. It is imperative that you turn in a Teacher Update 
            form at your weekly meetings after each letter drop-off or pick-up 
            in order for the changes to be processed. 
          <li>Once the change is processed, the affected Swing Kid(s) will be 
            contacted by email; at the next weekly meeting, you will receive a 
            processed change sheet and updated class list for your own records. 
            Be prepared--Swing Kids will come to YOU with questions about this! 
          <li>Work with your Swing Kids to build pen pal relations. Maybe sponsor 
            a letter-writing party, organize a pizza party, go rock-n-bowling...it 
            is all up to you 
        </ul>
