        <td colspan="2">As a BookMARK Coordinator, you will organize and supervise a weekly BookMARK session in which college students visit an elementary school classroom to work with K-5 students, helping them with reading, writing, and other special assignments. While you are the main contact for your BookMARKers and teacher, you also have the opportunity to work with the elementary students on a regular basis and encourage them to keep reading, writing, swingin', and
          smilin' !
          <p><font size="5" color="#0B007E"><em>Main Responsibilities:</em></font></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Organize and supervise each weekly BookMARK session</li>
            <li>Communicate regularly with your teacher, volunteers, and BookMARK 
              Director</li>
            <li>Ensure punctuality and dedication among volunteers</li>
            <li>Work with BookMARK Director and teacher to determine weekly session 
              activities</li>
            <li>Maintain regular communication with the Hall Heads who are also 
              working with your classroom</li>
          </ul>
          <p><font size="5" color="#0B007E"><em>Volunteers:</em><b><br>
            </b></font><br>
          Volunteers begin signing up for BookMARK sessions online at the beginning of each semester. Each week you will visit the virtual office to view the volunteers signed up for your session. You will contact your volunteers prior to their first session and provide them with all necessary information. While some volunteers will remain consistent throughout the semester, many volunteers will sign up later in the semester. Therefore, each week you may have new volunteers, who will need to receive the "I'm a BookMARKer" sheet and understand all classroom guidelines before going to the school.</p>
          <p>You should call and email volunteers each week to remind them about sessions. Encourage them to keep you updated when they are unable to attend a session, as their elementary school buddies are expecting them each week.</p>
          <p><b><font size="5" color="#0B007E">Weekly Sessions:</font></b></p>
          <p>Your BookMARK session will take place each week, according to the schedule set at the beginning of the semester. The BookMARK Director will take you to meet your BookMARK teacher before the first session.  During this meeting you and your teacher will discuss how often you will plan the activities for your session, as will as determine how the volunteers will be working with the elementary school students (i.e. on math, science, reading, etc.). This information will be placed on the K-grams website along with your contact information so volunteers can reach you as necessary. Here are some things to keep in mind during your weekly sessions:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Teachers: You should contact your teacher two days prior to your 
              weekly session and let him/her know how many volunteers will be 
              attending that week. Also, this is your time to finalize all plans 
              and activities for that session.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Meeting Time and Place: Volunteers will meet at the Cube (behind 
              the Michigan Union and LSA Building) at the designated time each 
              week. The meeting time will be approximately 25 minutes before the 
              session starts.<br>
            </li>
            <li>Transportation: You are responsible for transporting volunteers 
              to and from the session in a safe manner. Transportation will be 
              coordinated through the Ginsberg Center (located at the corner of 
              East University &amp; Hill Street, along with volunteer drivers. 
              You will check out a car from the Ginsberg Center before each session 
              and return it after your session (See Tips and Suggestions).&nbsp;<br>
            </li>
            <li>Safety: As a volunteer, you will help create an atmosphere in 
              which the little kids are safe, comfortable, and encouraged to learn. 
              You must ensure that volunteers follow all safety guidelines as 
              mentioned on the "I'm a BookMARK Volunteer" sheet.</li>
