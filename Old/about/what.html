        <p>The main program in K-grams is the pen pal program that pairs up over 1,000 

          college student with elementary students from nine schools in Southeastern 

          Michigan for monthly letter exchanges. The pen pal program welcomes 

          only college students who are residents in one of the <a href="../hallschool/participate.html" onClick="NewWindow(this.href,'demo','300','425','no');return false;">traditional 

          residence halls</a> on U of M's campus. Giving residents an opportunity 

          to interact with outside communities, K-grams helps college students 

          create a sense of pride and community within their residence halls. 

          Through letter writing parties, rez hall socials, mentoring, classroom 

          projects, and other special programs, residents are encouraged to have 

          fun and get involved within their hall.</p>















    <p>College students sign up during Welcome Week (first week in September) to

    become pen pals. Once they are chosen, they are matched up with an

    elementary school student.&nbsp; Each month, college pen pals write to and

    receive letters from their elementary buddies, while taking advantage of the

    many opportunities to meet their buddies through BookMARK, classroom

    projects, and Kids-Fair.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>A mentoring and reading program, <a href="../bookmark.html">K-grams

    BookMARK</a> (Mentoring And Reading with Kids) gives college students the

    opportunity to visit elementary school classrooms on a weekly basis to work

    with K-5 students, helping them with reading, writing, and other special

    assignments. This program welcomes EVERYONE on campus to participate.

    Organized into daily sessions, BookMARK takes place Monday through Friday at

    different times during the day. As determined by the BookMARK Coordinators

    and teachers, each session is set up slightly different. While many sessions

    involve volunteers working one-on-one with students, some sessions include

    working in groups and facilitating group activities, depending on the needs

    of the classroom.</p>

    <p><a href="../programs/ongoing.html">Class projects</a> are &quot;edu-active&quot;

    elementary school classrooms to interact with and engage K-5 students in a

    valuable educational experience. These special &quot;kids programs&quot;

    provide college students with an opportunity to visit the classrooms on a

    regular basis and work with students face-to-face.</p>

    <p>Ranging from writing stories to interactive mock elections, there are

    unlimited project ideas! Projects often build upon themes and subjects that

    the little kids are learning about during the year. They are typically

    organized by the Project Heads for the different residence halls, but ANYONE

    is welcome to brainstorm project ideas and help organize them.</p>

          Kids-Fair</a>, where elementary school pen pals, college students, parents, 
          teachers, and faculty fill Crisler Arena to celebrate <i>Reading, Writing, 
          Swingin,' and Smilin' </i>at the University of Michigan. This expansive 
          participation makes Kids-Fair the single largest student-run volunteer 
          event on campus. These elementary school pen pals spend an entire day 
          with college buddies, participate in hundreds of activities sponsored 
          by over 100 student organizations, and experience different highlights 
          of college in one day!</p>
