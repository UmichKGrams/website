      <p>Rishi Moudgil's idea started off simple seven months ago: to launch a 
        pen pal program between fellow U-M dorm students and K-5 elementary children 
        from area Washtenaw County schools. <br>
      </p>
      <p>A twice-a-month writing back and forth.<br>
      </p>
      <p>A little getting to know each other.<br>
      </p>
      <p>A nice simple community outreach program.<br>
      </p>
      <p>But early on, simple was taken out of the equation and on Friday Moudgil's 
        vision exploded inside Oosterbaan Fieldhouse as 850 children and their 
        850 pen pals converged for a sho-and-tell on college life, most seeing 
        each other for the first time.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Students, pen pals, teachers, and parents wove their way through tables 
        set up by 80 student organizations, each cleverly designed to make their 
        program eye-catching.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="images/Kids%20at%20a%20booth.JPG" border="0" vspace="6" hspace="6" align="left">They 
        banged on drums manned by members of the U-M Marching Band. <br>
        <br>
        Premed students used makeup to create fake bruises and bloody wounds, 
        complete with white cloth bandages. The pro-literacy group made bookmarks 
        of bright colored pipe cleaners and colorful fuzzy balls. Nursing students 
        let the children create real casts for their fingers. And Lambda Phi Epsilon, 
        a fraternity that supports Asian interests, gave away live goldfish, 300 
        in the first two hours alone.<br>
        <br>
        &quot;It is 40 times better that I ever thought,&quot; a tired, but pleased 
        Moudgil said. &quot;The kids are happy. That's what's important. The old 
        and the young kids.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        At the K-grams First Annual Kids-Fair, dozens of U-M student volunteers 
        moved with determined haste around thevast field house, many armed with 
        walkie-talkies to five or receive direction. They slid in and out of seats 
        behind tables covered with balloons, sparkles, clay, basketballs, puppets, 
        and crowns while the rhythms of the rock band Sugar Pill balsted from 
        the stage. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="+1">Pen Pals: Project 
        a learning experience for young, old</font></b></p>
      <p>Periodically, the band would break out with &quot;Hail to the Victors&quot; 
        and, as if on cue, most every U-M volunteer began clapping and punching 
        the air with a raised right fist.</p>
      <p>DeAndre Wilson, 10, a fifth-grader at Holmes Elementary School in Ypsilanti, 
        offered a grin through a face of sparkles, his arms dotted with newly-stamped 
        tattoos.</p>
      <p>&quot;She's pretty cute,&quot; he said, grinning up at Courtney Long, 
        his freshman pen pal. &quot;She is carrying all my stuff.&quot;</p>
      <p>Long smiled back.</p>
      <p>&quot;It was the second letter before I found out he wasn't a girl,&quot; 
        she said with a smile. &quot;I've learned about his family, school, the 
        things he likes to do. I think this is a great idea. It's a great way 
        to bridge a gap, and it gives the kids something to look forward to.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;And,&quot; she said, &quot;I met a new friend.&quot;</p>
      <p>Teachers had only praise for the program, targeted this year at Pattengill, 
        Pittsfield, Carpenter, Mitchell, Bryant, Northside, and Holmes elementary 
        schools.</p>
      <p><img src="images/ACS%20Booth.jpg" border="0" align="right" vspace="6" hspace="6">Sarah 
        Lynch teaches third, fourth, and fifth graders at Pittsfield Elementary 
        School. &quot;This is just great,&quot; she said, surveying the action. 
        &quot;I find kids of this age are really interested in college students 
        and teh college students can really act as role models. They've really 
        done a super job. This is so well organized and running so smoothly. And 
        it's all age appropriate. So many times things like this aren't.&quot;</p>
      <p>John Freeman, a third-grade teacher at Pittsfield, agreed.</p>
      <p>&quot;I think it's a great way for them to see what the future can hold 
        and it gives the kids a reason to study, to stay in school, to get excited 
        about college. </p>
      <p>&quot;It's good, too, for teh U-M students and helps them keep a foot 
        in the real world. Sometimes you have a tendency to forget where you came 
        from.&quot; </p>
      <p>Freeman also thinks the students got an educational benefit from it. 
        &quot;It helped the kids with their writing. They had to write and edit 
        their own work. A lot of thought went into this.&quot;</p>
      <p>Moudgil, a 20-year old junior and business major agreed.</p>
      <p>&quot;I really thought that if we made it easy to participate, that people 
        wouldbe enthusiastic about getting involved - and it worked. We have a 
        lot of dedicated volunteers.&quot;</p>
      <p>&quot;This (Kids-Fair) was never a part of the original plan. But the 
        kdis wanted to meet us. It grew from there. We wanted to do more.&quot;</p>
      <p>He praised fellow business majors and their organizational skills. &quot;A 
        lot of business students were involved in this and people sometimes don't 
        see them (as being this creative). But a lot of the skills we used are 
        the skills we'll need. I had great volunteers.&quot;</p>
