        Matches Kids with College-Student Mentors</font></b></p>
      <p><i>Monday, January 20, 2003</i></p>
      <p>By Mary Lendzion</p>
      <p>When 1,000 elementary school students meet their college-student mentors 
        from the University of Michigan for the fifth annual K-grams Kids-Fair 
        on March 21, it will be because K-grams founder, Rishi Moudgil, saw a 
        need for a one-on-one mentoring and learning program.<img src="images/Rishi-freep.jpg" align="left" vspace="6" hspace="6"><br>
        <br>
        Moudgil, 24, of Ann Arbor started K-grams in 1998 at the end of his sophomore 
        year at Michigan. He graduated in 2000 with a degree in Business Administration 
        and works at the University's Center for Research on Learning and Teaching. 
        He is a graduate of Rochester High School.</p>
      <p>K-grams, short for Kids Programs, pairs students in kindergarten through 
        fifth grade with college pen pals so they can develop a mentoring relationship. 
        The program started with about seven schools and 750 mentors. Now, there 
        are ten schools and 1,500 mentors. The schools are Bryant, Carpenter, 
        Mitchell, Pittsfield, Northside, and Dicken elementaries in Ann Arbor, 
        Ford and Holmes elementary schools in Ypsilanti, and Vetal School and 
        Gompers Elementary in Detroit.</p>
      <p>&quot;I was fortunate enough to get involved the first year of the program, 
        and throughout the past five years, I've had the pleasure of working with 
        Rishi,&quot; said Ani Shehigian of Livonia, Treasurer of K-grams and a 
        2002 graduate of the university. &quot;He is a very dynamic leader, and 
        he is working to expand th program beyond the University of Michigan.&quot;</p>
      <p>For his efforts, Moudgil received this year's Grand Angel Award from 
        Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. He accepted the Grand Angel trophy 
        and a check for $5,000 in November at and awards celebration.</p>
      <p>&quot;Through Rishi's work now as the President of K-grams, Inc., his 
        main focus is to expand to other colleges and universities throughout 
        the country,&quot; said Shehigian. &quot;The money that we received through 
        Blue Cross will help the dream of expanding the program come true.&quot;</p>
