        a recent sunny morning, Rishi Moudgil walked into Peter Larson's fifth-grade 
        classroom at Carpenter Elementary School in Pittsfield Township and blended 
        right in with the students working on a class project. 
        <p>Moudgil, 24, a 2000 University of Michigan graduate, is a fixture
          in local classrooms, pairing U-M students and elementary school students
          as pen pals and buddies, visiting schools and organizing a massive
          campus volunteer force whose members work as mentors and tutors. </p>
        <p>Last month, Moudgil, founder and president of K-grams (a shortened 
          form of Kids Programs), received the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan's 
          Grand Angel Award for volunteer work that benefits children. He won 
          the $5,000 top award from among 88 nominations. </p>
        <p>&quot;I never expected to be honored this way,&quot; he said. &quot;This
          donation will help support our plans to continue and to expand our
          program. My dream is to expand K-grams and have chapters at colleges
          and universities throughout the U.S.&quot; </p>
        <p>Currently, 2,000 U-M volunteers, mostly from residence halls, work
          with 1,300 elementary students in 55 classrooms at 10 elementary schools
          in Ann Arbor, Ypsilanti and Detroit. </p>
        <p>Every other week, paired college students and elementary pupils exchange 
          letters, trading introductions and pleasantries and seeking and offering

		   advice. It's a relationship that culminates in a face-to-face encounter 
          in a classroom visit or at a K-grams Kids Fair on the U-M campus, this 
          year scheduled for March 21 at Crisler Arena.
        <p>Moudgil launched K-grams in the summer of 1998, while he was serving
          as president of Circle K, a community service club. Moudgil, then a
          junior in business school, thought an on-going relationship between
          university students and school children could benefit both groups. </p>
        <p>Pete Larson, a fifth-grade teacher at Carpenter, likes the program
          because his students learn to write for a specific reader and purpose. </p>
        <p>&quot;It gives the kids an opportunity to have an audience for their
          writing, not as a class assignment,&quot; Larson said. </p>
        <p>&quot;It kind of gives the kids here an idea what college is like,&quot; he
          added. &quot;Letters written back and forth, talking about exams, classes,
          different things. Kids really like the interaction when their pen pals
          come to visit the classroom.&quot; </p>
        <p>Tamico Taliaferro, 10, has had U-M pen pals for four years. &quot;I
          like it because I was writing to somebody,&quot; said the Carpenter
          fifth-grader. &quot;We say what we like. I like basketball. We describe
          what we look like,&quot; she said, adding that she is looking forward
          to meeting her current pen pal. </p>
        <p>Another fifth-grader, Ionatan Mazza, 10, found he and his correspondent
          have a common interest - the Red Wings. &quot;We write back and forth,&quot; he
          said. &quot;Sometimes I ask him if the Red Wings won if I didn't watch
          the game. He writes about college life. It's tiring, but he enjoys
          it. I can write anything I want to.&quot; </p>
        <p><img src="images/rishi2.jpg" alt="Rishi Moudgil reads a collection of letters with fifth-graders from Carpenter Elementary in Pittsfield Township." width="210" height="285" align="left">Recruiting 
          and training volunteers to become pen pals is a year-round process, 
          Moudgil said. </p>
        <p>&quot;We target mostly freshmen and second-year students,&quot; he
          said. &quot;A lot of students don't normally do community work. They
          join K-grams because it's simple.&quot; </p>
        <p>He said the pairing of 8-year-olds and 18-year-old college students
          is ideal because the kids feel connected to the adults as mentors and
          at the same time as friends. </p>
        <p>The program has a $35,000 budget, mostly U-M allocations from Student
          Government and U-M Housing funds. </p>
        <p>&quot;I am very passionate about kids while engaging people of my generation,&quot; 
          Moudgil said. &quot;It's very rewarding to me. No matter how much effort 
          you put in, it's going to benefit kids.&quot; </p>
