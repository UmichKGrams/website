      <p><b><font size="5">Gymnasts Take Message to School</font></b></p>
      <p><i>Monday, March 18, 2002</i></p>
      <p>By Corey Roepken<br>
        College Notes</p>
      <p>Being a college athlete is more than practice and competition. It has 
        a lot to do with being a role model, and the female gymnasts at the University 
        of Michigan are doing their part.</p>
      <p>On March 7, the Wolverines traveled to the Vetal School on the northwest 
        side of Detroit to talk to fourt-graders and put on an exhibition as part 
        of K-grams, a nonprofit organization focused on building relationships 
        between college students and elementary pupils.</p>
      <p>&quot;It offers both sides a comfortable way to get to know each other,&quot; 
        said Rishi Moudgil, the president of K-grams and a former U-M student. 
        &quot;It establishes that connection between two groups of students that 
        normally wouldn't happen.&quot;</p>
      <p>On the way into the building, if the kids had walked any closer behind 
        the gymnasts, they would have stepped on their heels. The reaction from 
        the young students once inside was simply fantastic.</p>
      <p>The kids aren't from the most upscale of neighborhoods and have not had 
        the same opportunities or seen the same things as a lot of college students, 
        so when senior Amy Kuczera did the splits and coach Bev Plocki pulled 
        up on one of Kuczera's legs, it was, at the time, the coolest - and most 
        excruciating - thing they had ever seen. They also cheered loudly when 
        they found out sophomore Elise Ray was the captain of the 2000 Olympic 
        team and that sophomore Calli Ryals was the nation's top all-around gymnast 
        this season.</p>
      <p>The fascination didn't stop there. They screamed their approval, oddly 
        enough, when senior Shannon MacKenzie said she wanted to be a math teacher. 
        When given the opportunity to ask the gymnasts anything they wanted, the 
        kids came up with, &quot;What's your favorite cartoon?&quot; and &quot; 
        Do you know karate?&quot; - to which Ryals, who proved her kung fu abilities 
        at a social event during last season's NCAA championship meet, answered 
        yes.</p>
      <p>The main message the Wolverines passed along was that with hard work 
        and commitment, anyone can succeed and go to college. They wanted the 
        kids to know anything was possible.</p>
      <p>&quot;It's nice to get out and do something in the community, and it's 
        really, really nice to get to know the kids,&quot; Ray said. &quot;Hopefully, 
        at least something we say will stick and give them inspiration.&quot;</p>
