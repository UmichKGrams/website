          </font></i></b>The moment the volunteers walk through the door of Mrs. 
          Stewart&#8217;s 1st grade classroom, the faces of the students quickly 
          brighten as they greet us with huge smiles! The teacher splits the kids 
          into groups and with the help of a volunteer, each group picks the perfect 
          spot to go sit. We read stories that the students had picked out from 
          their school library moments earlier and then play fun math card games. 
          When it&#8217;s time for us to leave, we collect our heartfelt hugs 
          and leave the classroom with the satisfaction of knowing that we had 
          brightened the day of 20 first grade students. :) </font></p>

          grade classroom-all the kids look up, smile and yell, &#8220;hi!!&#8221; 
          Then we break up into groups and work on their spelling. They practice 
          by finger painting, twisting pipe cleaners, or making letters with marshmallows 
          and pretzels. When it&#8217;s finally time to go, all the kids line 
          up to hug us goodbye and ask if we would come back tomorrow. We always 
          look forward to next week!</font></p>

          on homework are just a few of the fun things we do each week. The kids 
          are always excited to have college students visit, and would love for

          out with these first graders. They look up to us (both literally and 
          figuratively), and they cherish every minute that we are there. Time 
          really flies by when you are playing with these kids. Come to BookMARK 
          for a great break from homework,<br>

          at Carpenter Elementary, you suddenly feel as though time has reversed 
          itself. Almost in an instant, you have escaped the chaos of college 
          life and are back in the world of mini-desks, story time, and simplicity. 
          This experience is the epitome of being mutually beneficial. While the 
          kids are excited about learning with their 'cool' college buddies, you, 
          at least for the hour, can take a break from college and just have fun. 
          Come join us on Thursday mornings for this unique experience!</font></p>
