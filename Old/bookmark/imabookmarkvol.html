        <td colspan="2">As a K-grams BookMARK (Mentoring And Reading with Kids) volunteer, you'll visit an elementary school classroom(s) each week and become buddies with K-5 students.  From reading and writing to playing math games and helping with special assignments, your role is integral in mentoring students on a regular basis and encouraging them to keep reading, writing, swingin', and smilin' !&nbsp;

         <p><font size="5" color="#0B007E"><i>Main Responsibilities:</i></font></p>

          <ul>
            <li>Actively engage in each BookMARK session: participate in classroom activities, establish a positive relationship with the class, and get to know other college volunteers</li>
            <li>Sign up for as many sessions as your schedule allows! You can participate in more than one BookMARK session each week.</li>
            <li>Attend the sessions for which you sign up. If you are unable to attend a session, contact your BookMARK Coordinator and let him/her know.<br>
            </li>
          </ul>

         <p><font size="5" color="#0B007E"><i>My BookMARK Coordinator:</i></font></p>

          <p>BookMARK sessions take place Monday through Friday at different times 
            each day. Each session is set up according to the needs of the classroom 
            and is supervised by a BookMARK Coordinator, who is the link between 
            the BookMARK classroom and K-grams throughout the semester. Your Coordinator 
            is the contact person for your session and can answer any questions 
            that you may have. Your Coordinator's contact information is located 
            below and on the K-grams website at www.umich.edu/~smile, whenever 
            you need to get in touch with him/her. If you have a question or concern 
            and are unable to reach your Coordinator, please email <a href="mailto:bookmark@umich.edu">bookmark@umich.edu</a>.<br>

         <br>

         <i><font size="5" color="#0B007E">My BookMARK Session:</font></i></p>

         <p>Your BookMARK Coordinator and the teacher determine what you will do during each session. You may work one-on-one with an elementary school student, read with a group of students, or help facilitate classroom group activities. Check out the website for a description of your session! Before your first session, here are a few things that you need to know:</p>

         <ul>

          <li><b>Meeting Time and Place</b><br>
              You'll meet your Coordinator and the other volunteers at the Cube 
              (the area behind the Michigan Union and LSA Building) each week 
              before your session. The time at which you meet your group depends 
              on your session times and will be established by your Coordinator. 
              Check out the <a href="applynew2.html">schedule</a> for specific 
              meeting times!</li>

          <li><b>Safety</b><br>

            As a volunteer, you'll help create an atmosphere in which the little kids are safe, comfortable, and encouraged to learn.  Please keep in mind the following when working in the classroom:<br>
            <br>
            - Do NOT give elementary school students your email address, home address, or phone number<br>
            - Be mindful of your language (i.e. do not mention inappropriate topics or use obscenities)<br>
            - If a kid mentions something that might be a cause for concern, notify the teacher or your Coordinator immediately<br>
            - Do NOT bring presents, candy, pictures, etc. unless every student receives the same thing&nbsp;<br>
            - Do NOT bring any distracting items into the classroom (cell phones, keys, books, etc.)  Leave all of these items in the car</li>

         </ul>

          <p align="center"><b>If you have any questions or concerns, please contact 
            your <a href="../spc/meetcoordinators.html"> BookMARK Coordinator</a>
