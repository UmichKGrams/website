<h1> Pen Pal Program </h1>
<h2> I'm a Pen Pal - So now what do I do? </h2>
<p> Welcome to K-grams! Without you this program would not be possible, as college pen pals are the foundation of everything that K-grams does. As a pen pal, you have the unique opportunity of writing to an elementary school kid each month and working with him/her throughout the year. Before you write your first letter, there are a few things you need to know in order to understand your role as a college pen pal. <br <br>

<h2> What's my mission? </h2>
<ol>
<li>Establish a relationship with your elementary pen pal by becoming a friend and mentor.</li>
<li>Create pride and a rich sense of community among the pen pals in your residence hall.</li>
</ol>
<h2> How do I do that? </h2>
<ol>
<li>Write your letter each month.</li>
<li>Interact with your elementary pen pal by visiting the classroom to do various projects.</li>
<li>Get to know other college pen pals through programs sponsored in your residence hall such as letter writing parties and pizza social.</li>
<li>Participate in the K-grams Kid's Fair (during winter term).</li>
</ol>
<h2> How else can I get involved? </h2>
<ol>
<li>Sign up for <a href = "#bookmark-about">K-grams BookMARK</a> (Mentoring and Reading with Kids).</li>
<li>Help out at K-day and other special projects.</li>
<li>Check out the K-grams Calendar to find out about more opportunities to get involved!</li>
</ol>
<h2> Who is my Swing Kid? </h2>
<p> As you write letters throughout the year, you will have a U of M "Swing Kid" who is there to help you. Your Swing Kid will serve as your liaison to all aspects of the program. He/she will make sure you turn your letter in on time, proofread the content of the letter, and also inform you of upcoming events.<br><br>

Your Swing Kid is a great resource, and you may contact this person if you have any questions or want to get more involved in K-grams throughout the year - in fact, there is a good chance they live right down the hall from you. You can help them plan a social event, a letter writing party in your residence hall, or coordinate a gift to give to your pen pal's class. You will receive your Swing Kid's information at your hall's pen pal kick-off.
