<h1>BookMARK</h1>
				
<p>In addition to our pen pal program, K-grams also runs weekly edu-active BookMARK sessions in the classrooms. Any member of the university community is welcome to sign up to participate in BookMARK sessions.  All BookMARK sessions meet at the Cube at their designated start time and return to the Cube at their designated end time.  Activities may include science time, math stations, or even recess.  Some volunteers go once a week, some once a month, some just once.  With any of those options we guarantee a good time for all.</p>

<h2>Who is Involved?</h2>

<h3>Teachers:</h3>

<p>Teachers of the class tailor the program to their individual classroom. After meeting with a K-grams BookMARK Director and the BookMARK Coordinator for that session, the teacher chooses what will happen during that session.</p> 

<h3>Volunteers:</h3>
<p>To volunteer, just fill out the <a href = "https://goo.gl/forms/jVrp9dCyWq8kbJfP2">form</a> and sign up for the sessions that you can attend. You can volunteer weekly, monthly, or whenever your schedule allows. From there, volunteers can be involved as much as they like, depending on their personal experiences and whether or not they can resist those cute, little kids. Further involvement then happens with teacher approval.</p>

<h3>Maintenance:</h3>

<p>The BookMARK Coordinators monitor the program throughout the year. The coordinators are responsible for making sure the minimum number of volunteers go to the school each week and that they have proper transportation.They also help the teacher with planning fun activities for the students to do during BookMARK visits.</p>
