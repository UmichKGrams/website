<h1>What is K-grams?</h1>
<p> Short for "Kids Programs," K-grams is a mentoring and learning program that pairs up college and elementary school students through a suite of programs. An entirely student-led organization, K-grams brings people together from all facets of the University of Michigan campus and the local community. </p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>
The mission of K-grams is to establish a strong community of learning for a wide range of college and elementary students, staff, and families by developing positive relationships and experiences that extend beyond the classroom.
</p>
<h2>Programs</h2>
<p>K-grams presents the following programs:</p>

<h3>Pen Pals</h3>
<p>K-grams' main program is our pen pal program that pairs up over 1,000 college students with elementary students from schools in Southeastern Michigan for monthly letter exchanges. The pen pal program welcomes mostly college students who are residents in one of the traditional residence halls on U of M's campus. Giving residents an opportunity to interact with outside communities, K-grams helps college students create a sense of pride and community within their residence halls. Through letter writing parties, rez hall socials, mentoring, classroom projects, and other special programs, residents are encouraged to have fun and get involved within their hall.</p>

<p>College students apply at the beginning of the year to become pen pals. Once they are chosen, they are matched up with an elementary school student.  Each month, college pen pals write to and receive letters from their elementary buddies, while taking advantage of the many opportunities to meet their buddies through BookMARK, classroom projects, and Kid's Fair.</p>

<h3>BookMARK</h3>
<p>A mentoring and reading program, K-grams BookMARK (Mentoring And Reading with Kids) gives college students the opportunity to visit elementary school classrooms on a weekly basis to work with K-5 students, helping them with reading, writing, and other special assignments. This program welcomes everyone on campus to participate. Organized into daily sessions, BookMARK takes place Monday through Friday at different times during the day. As determined by the BookMARK Coordinators and teachers, each session is set up in a slightly different way. While many sessions involve volunteers working one-on-one with students, some sessions include working in groups and facilitating group activities, depending on the needs of the classroom.</p>

<p>Class projects are "edu-active" (educational and interactive) activities where college students visit elementary school classrooms to interact with and engage K-5 students in a valuable educational experience. These special "kids programs" provide college students with an opportunity to visit the classrooms on a regular basis and work with students face-to-face.</p>

<p>Ranging from writing stories to interactive mock elections, there are unlimited project ideas! Projects often build upon themes and subjects that the kids are learning about during the year. They are typically organized by the Hall Heads for the different residence halls, but anyone is welcome to brainstorm project ideas and help organize them.</p>

<h3>Kid's Fair</h3>
<p>At the end of the year K-grams holds our biggest event, Kids' Fair, where elementary school pen pals, college students, parents, teachers, and faculty celebrate a year of friendship and learning. This expansive participation makes Kid's Fair the single largest student-run volunteer event on campus. These elementary school pen pals spend an entire day with college buddies, participate in hundreds of activities sponsored by over 100 student organizations, and experience many different highlights of college in one day!

<h1> K-grams History </h1>

<h2> 1998-1999: The Building Blocks </h2>
<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>K-grams was officially founded in the summer of 1998 by Rishi Moudgil, a sophomore at the University of Michigan. Already very active within the volunteer community, Rishi saw the need for establishing an ongoing relationship between college students and children. While seeing other mentoring/tutoring programs as somewhat cumbersome, he recognized the potential for a pen pal program between university residence halls and elementary schools - a simple yet effective way to establish these community relationships. Rishi took these enormous possibilities for the program and began to solicit his friends and colleagues to help launch the program. By the June of 1998, he had already named the program K-grams (short for Kids Programs) and the first official meeting was July 16th with a half-dozen eager volunteers!</p>

<h3>Expanding the Horizons:</h3>
<p>Six Ann Arbor elementary schools - Bryant, Carpenter, Mitchell, Northside, Pattengill, and Pittsfield - were initially recruited to join the program. Nine residence halls were originally chosen, and, as the school year approached, heavy recruiting began. A total of 750 University students were brought into the program in less than two weeks by long days and nights of recruiting relentlessly though Welcome Week and the residence halls! At the beginning of the second semester, K-grams expanded to its first school outside of Ann Arbor - Holmes Elementary School in Ypsilanti. By the end of its first year, K-grams reached over 850 University pen pals and laid a framework for the organization to continue to grow.</p>

<h3>The First K-grams Kid's Fair:</h3>
<p>The program expanded in other ways, too - pen pals began doing projects! Projects included activities at schools and in-hall events as well. These successful interactions between "big kids" and "little kids" sparked the idea for Kid's Fair, the culminating event that brought together teachers, parents, faculty, pen pals, and volunteers to conclude a successful first year for K-grams. The original Kid's Fair was planned for Palmer Field, but then moved to Oosterbaan Fieldhouse and included 115 student groups in its first year. Live entertainment, yellow shirts, charity drive for school supplies, collecting box tops for education, and many great student booths highlighted a day where kids of all ages learned together with each other!</p>

<h2>1999-2001 Establishing Lasting Programs</h2>
<h3>The Millenium Mark</h3>
<p>The popularity, immense growth, and success of the first year of K-grams led to strengthening the organizational structure in the second year. This included gaining an office, maintaining a fully interactive website, holding the first KPC Leadership Retreat, and expanding all programs. By the year 2000, K-grams expanded to include all the traditional residence halls, over 1,000 university pen pals, and hundreds of off-campus volunteers. Inclusion of Vetal School in Detroit helped move the mission forward by bridging communities and creating even more positive relationships. The culmination of a phenomenal K-grams year occurred at the Second Annual Kids’ Fair 2000. Thousands of elementary and college pen pals, buddies, and student groups filled Crisler Arena on Friday, March 17 for the first day-long Kids’ Fair.</p>
<h3>Campus Partnerships</h3>
<p>The K-grams partnership with Housing allowed students to have great new resources within the halls. Student groups soon began to express an interest to get involved so "Swing Sessions" were created as a way to allow groups to partner up with buddies and pen pals for class projects. Undergraduates in a Living / Learning community at Alice Lloyd (LHSP) also benefited by participating in a special class pertaining to the benefits of K-grams and community service. All funding for the enormous budget came within the U of M community, making K-grams and Kids’ Fair a truly collegiate event. Finally, K-grams also began expanding to other colleges to help create similar programs across the nation!</p>
<h3>Plethora of Projects</h3>
<p>Deepening pen pal relations was accomplished by offering pen pals multiple opportunities to interact with their pen pal. Projects in the classrooms were offered more regularly and became "edu-active" (educational and interactive) to further benefit the kids. Teachers began including K-grams as part of their curriculum more and more as the program became well respected. A reading program entitled BookMARK (Mentoring And Reading with Kids) was also created and established through each elementary school. By the fall of 2000, the K-Day was created to bring little kids to campus during first term and learn about various aspects of college life. At the Third Annual Kids’ Fair, each little kid received an official K-grams diploma and a picture of their college pen pal to boot!</p>

<h2>2002 Building on Tradition</h2>
<h3>Building Beyond Campus</h3>
<p>As K-grams established it's strength and presence on campus, it followed that the program's reach would begin to stretch off-campus into the surrounding communities. By actively seeking the advice, input and feedback from members of the elementary school community, from teachers to kids, parents to principals, the objectives of K-grams were only further enhanced, both at Michigan and on the national scale.</p>

<h3>A Staple at Michigan</h3>
<p>By 2002, K-grams had solidified its status at Michigan as one of the largest student run organizations. As the KPC membership rose to 70, K-grams entered a new level of campus recognition and influence. Kids’ Fair 2002 was highlighted by buddy attendance of over 800 and for the first year, a theme to unite all aspects of the day, "Smilin' Around the World." By offering simple community service opportunities to a wide range of University students, K-grams only further strives to exceed its mission.</p>

<h3>Passing on Tradition</h3>
<p>Spring of 2002 marked the graduation of the first "class" of K-grams participants - those for whom K-grams had always been around. From this point on, every member of the K-grams Leadership has had the opportunity to be a pen pal - the role that the success of K-grams rests upon!</p>

<h2>2003-2007 Expansion and Growth</h2>
<h3>Growth on Campus</h3>
<p>Because it was already so well known, K-grams was able to use this time to further establish itself and begin building additional partnerships on campus at the University of Michigan. This time frame saw one of our first years with over 1,000 pen pals. This was due in large part to our continued relationship with University Housing and our new relationship with the Greek System at the University of Michigan which would expand and grow in the upcoming years.</p>

<h3>Growth off campus</h3>
<p>With the popularity of the Pen Pal and BookMARK programs growing in the schools that we partner with, K-grams was able to expand its reach to even more elementary schools in the Ann Arbor, Willow Run, and Detroit School Districts. This time frame oversaw some of the largest expansion in K-grams since its inception.</p>

<h2>2007-2017 New and Lasting Relationships</h2>
<h3>Lasting Relationships</h3>
<p>This time period saw K-grams further its relationship with the Department of Housing and the Greek System at the University of Michigan. The Department of Housing and RHA became large allies in recruiting the necessary amounts of pen pals in the early weeks of school. Additionally, the Greek System has had a continually increasing role in the program, as in 2010 when we incorporated four Greek houses into our pen pal program and several more into our BookMARK program.</p>

<h3>New Relationships</h3>
<p>In addition to continuing and expanding our established relationships, K-grams also began creating new connections between 2007 and 2010. Most of these new relationships were with student groups who began taking a role larger than a booth at Kids' Fair including presenting at KPC meetings and attending BookMARK sessions and Classroom Projects.</p>

<h3>Kids' Fair</h3>
<p>The Kids' Fairs of 2008-2016 were some of the largest and most successful that K-grams has had in its long history.  The themes were "I want my K-TV," "Kids Karnival," "Kids' Fair Through the Ages," "K-games," “K-grams in Neverland,” K-zoo,” and “When I Grow Up,” “Superheros,” and “K-grams in Space,” respectively.  All of these events showed increased participation from pen pals and student group volunteers who all came together to show the elementary students a day of fun and learning.</p>
